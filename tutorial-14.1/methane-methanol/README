# Make input files for FEP
#
# By default, input files for FEP/lambda-REMD are generated.
# If you want to perform distributed computation instead of REMD, 
# change md_type to "distributed" in make_inp.sh. In that case 
# input files for each lambda window are generated.
./make_input.sh

# Equilibration & FEP Simulation
#
# If you use distributed parallel jobs, make job files using
# make_job.sh and run job_bakapara.sh after job_eq.sh.
./job_eq.sh
./job_fepremd.sh

# Postprocessing
#
# If you perform distributed computation instead of REMD, 
# change md_type to "distributed" in post_run.sh.
./post_run.sh

# Calculation of ddG
#
# Execute following script to get the relative solvation free energy
./calc_ddG.py
